# SW - game on Arduino
Easy game created on Arduino simulator - TinkerCad.
Main Arduino prepare sequence of number, then send it to two other Arduinos using I2C. One Arduino is responsible for showing this sequence on LCD and other operate on keyboard - check if sequence choose by gamer is the same, then main Arduino sends info to Arduino with LCD if user win or lose so it can show this info on screen. If users won all 10 levels Arduino find new random sequence.
